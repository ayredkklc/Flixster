### Notes
THe API website was not responding to my request so I couldn't add the videos for the trailers.
Also the API website was giving the boolean false for the the videos of the movies so I couldnt get the trailers of the movies, but I added my own video.
So when clicked onthe poster the video I put appears instead of the actual trailer of the movie.
